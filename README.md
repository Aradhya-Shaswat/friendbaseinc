### If You (the person who tries to run our app through `npm run dev`) Shows a error Do :
1) Contact us 
2) Check if all the files are there (notable mention : `.env.development` can only be given to you by Arsh so contact him not me I don't get the tokens :(
3) Try to run `npm i --force` as `npm i --legacy-peer-deps` sometimes does not work (for me).
